        "question": "How long does it take to become conversational?",
        "answer": "Most students start having basic conversations within 2-3 months of consistent practice. Our method focuses on practical, everyday language from day one, so you'll be speaking sooner than you think. The key is regular practice—even 15-20 minutes daily can lead to significant progress."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Do I need any prior knowledge to start?",
        "answer": "Not at all! Our courses are designed for complete beginners as well as intermediate learners. We'll assess your current level and create a personalized learning path that matches your goals and experience."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What makes Aviya's method different from apps like Duolingo?",
        "answer": "Unlike gamified apps that focus on translation exercises, our courses emphasize real conversation skills, proper pronunciation, and cultural context. You'll learn from a native speaker who provides personalized feedback, not just automated responses. Our video lessons let you see facial expressions and mouth movements, which is crucial for proper pronunciation."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Can I learn at my own pace?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! All lessons are pre-recorded and available 24/7, so you can learn whenever it fits your schedule. Whether you prefer intensive daily sessions or a more relaxed pace, our platform adapts to your lifestyle."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Is there a free trial available?",
        "answer": "Yes! Your first lesson is completely free with no credit card required. This gives you a chance to experience our teaching style and see if it's the right fit for you before committing to a full course."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What if I get stuck or need extra help?",
        "answer": "We're here to support you! You can reach out directly for clarification on any lesson, and we offer personalized feedback on your progress. Our community of learners also provides a supportive environment where you can practice and ask questions."
